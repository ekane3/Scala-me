AIRPORTS  

A scala application web application that will ask the user for two actions : Query or Reports.  

Query Option will ask the user for the country name or code and print the airports & runways at each airport. The input can be country code or country name. The input can also be a fuzzy matching logic for partial entered country name. e.g. entering zimb will result in Zimbabwe :)

Choosing Reports will print the following possibly through a menu :
- 10 countries with highest number of airports (with count) and countries with lowest number of airports. 
- Type of runways per country
- Print the top 10 most common runway latitude.
